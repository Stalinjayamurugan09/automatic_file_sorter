📁 Automatic File Sorter in File Explorer

This Python script automates the process of organizing files in a specified directory by sorting them into folders based on their file type. It detects .csv, .png, and .txt files in a given folder and moves them into appropriate subfolders such as csv files, image files, and text files.

🚀 Features
Automatically creates subfolders for different file types.

Moves files into respective folders based on extension.

Prevents overwriting by checking if the file already exists in the target folder.

Easy to configure with a customizable file path.

🧠 How It Works
Set the path variable to the target folder you want to organize.

The script checks for the presence of files with specific extensions.

It creates the destination folders if they don't already exist.

Moves each file to its corresponding folder.
